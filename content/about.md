Hi everyone! My name is Matthew Parvaneh, and I'm in my third-year of studies in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

Currently, I'm working as an Associate Software Engineer at Flipp. I work on the Content Collection team, making use of a stack that is centered around Ruby on Rails, AWS, and Apache Kafka.
